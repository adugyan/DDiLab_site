## 👋 Welcome to the DdiLab

<!--StartFragment-->

NIU’s Data, Devices, and Interaction Laboratory (ddiLab) supports a range of computer science research projects, with an emphasis on visualization and data analysis coupled to high-performance computing in the support of science. 

DdiLab co-directors Joseph Insley (School of Art and Design) and Michael Papka (Department of Computer Science) are leading several collaborative research projects focused on the interaction between user and tools; specifically, how computers support and enhance knowledge and discovery. The ddiLab provides opportunities for NIU students to assist with research related to these and future projects.
